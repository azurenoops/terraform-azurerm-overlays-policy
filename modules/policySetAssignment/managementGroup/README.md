# Policy Set Assignment - Management Group

Assignments can be scoped from overarching management groups right down to individual resources

> ðŸ’¡ A role assignment and remediation task will be automatically created if any member definitions contain a list of `roleDefinitionIds`. This can be omitted with `skip_role_assignment = true`, or to assign roles at a different scope to that of the policy assignment use: `role_assignment_scope`. To successfully create Role-assignments (or group memberships) the deployment account may require the [User Access Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator) role at the `assignment_scope` or preferably the `definition_scope` to simplify workflows.
